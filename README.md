### About me 
Born in **Argentina** ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·, and based in **London, Ontario** ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦, where I am further honing my skills in mobile application development through a specialized program at **Fanshawe College**. My commitment to staying at the forefront of technology drives my passion for delivering innovative solutions and exceeding expectations in every project I undertake.

Since 2021, I've been working as a Product Manager for Arazy Group, a Vancouver-based MedTech company, working closely with the Canadian IT team on the SaaS that the company offers to their clients, through the use of **React.js, PostgreSQL, Java, and SpringBoot**. 

On top of that, Iâ€™ve started working as a **Software Developer** for the Canadian headquarters of this company on February 2024, earning a vast experience that pairs with what Iâ€™ve learned over my time at college, mostly on **ReactNative, Progressive Web Apps, Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift)** development.
